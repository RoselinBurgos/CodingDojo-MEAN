Restful Task API
Using your new knowledge of 'Restful Routing', create an application with endpoints (routing rules) 
which offer CRUD operations for 'tasks'. We should be able to use this API for the following commands:

GET: Retrieve all Tasks
GET: Retrieve a Task by ID
POST: Create a Task
PUT: Update a Task by ID
DELETE: Delete a Task by ID
