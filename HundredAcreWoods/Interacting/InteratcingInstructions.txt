Now that a player is able to walk around our map of the Hundred Acre Wood, 
let's make the game a little more interesting by giving the characters in the homes a chance to speak. 

Add a greet method to each of the home objects in your code and invoke them whenever the player visits a home.
Adjust the move function so that it invokes the greet method of the player's location

Start game by: move("north")
