In the last assignment, we created a map of the Hundred Acre Wood! Now let's use it to start building a simple game. 

Create the player object with the location attribute
Assign the player's location to the tigger object
Create the function move, which takes a direction as a parameter
When the move function is invoked, change the player's location accordingly and log a message
If the move function is passed an invalid direction, log a message to inform the user

Player starts at Tiggers house. Start game by: move("north")
